# Throwing-Exceptions

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of throwing an exception and catching it.

Design

My design includes 8 classes in total for the four required exceptions demos. There will be 2 for each exception called either Thrown or Catch. The four exceptions are NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ClassCastException, and IllegalArgumentException.
